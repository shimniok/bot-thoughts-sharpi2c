#summary How to update firmware on your I2C Adapter

For upgrades or ultimate hackability, you can download new firmware to the I2C Adapter.

The I2C Adapter uses an ATtiny24A microcontroller and supports the standard 6-pin AVRISP header. The pin header is not in the standard 6x2 configuration due to space constraints. Here's the pinout

|| *Adapter* || *AVRISP* ||
|| !R || !RESET ||
|| DI || MOSI ||
|| DO || MISO ||
|| SCL/SCK || SCK ||
|| V || VCC ||
|| G || GND ||

Just connect the appropriate pins to your AVR programmer and download the code as you normally would.

Note: avrdude doesn't (yet) support the t24a but you can use t24 as the target. That's what I do and it works fine.
