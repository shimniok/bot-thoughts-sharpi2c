#summary Easily upgrade your Sharp IR Sensor to I2C

= Introduction =

The Sharp IR Sensor is an analog sensor. When you don't have any analog channels to spare, this adapter saves the day by converting your sensor into an I2C device.

It's not just for the common GP2D12. It can upgrade _any_ analog Sharp IR sensor. And, for that matter, it will work with any analog sensor.

= Many, Many Sensors =

Do you need a lot of Sharp sensors?  You can have up to 27 of these on a single I2C bus, each with a unique address. Try that with analog.

= High Resolution, Low Noise =

The I2C Adapter features 1x to 4096X oversampling for effective 10-16 bit resolution for high precision conversions. A high performance exponential software filter reduces noise. Donversion rates of 125kSPS and the tuned analog anti-alias filter easily support the bandwidth of a Sharp sensor and more.

The result is a reliable, low noise, high resolution, digital signal worthy of the Sharp IR Sensor's capabilities. All the hard work's done for you so you can concentrate on the fun stuff: what do do with range information.
