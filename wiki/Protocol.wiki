#summary The simple, efficient I2C Adapter protocol

= Read The Sensor =

  * Send START
  * Send Read Address
  * READ high byte
  * READ low byte
  * Send STOP

By default, without specifying any other [Registers register] to read, the Adapter will respond with the high, then low byte of the raw Sensor conversion as many times as you follow the sequence above.

= Read A Register =

  * Send START
  * Send Write Address
  * Send Register Index
  * Send RESTART
  * Send Read Address
  * Read byte
  * Send STOP

If you want to read a particular [Registers register], simply write the requested register index, restart, and read the byte.

= Write A Register =

  * Send START
  * Send Write Address
  * Send Register Index
  * Send new register value
  * Send STOP

Just write to the adapter with the [Registers register] index and the new value.

= Read Multiple Registers =

  * Send START
  * Send Write Address
  * Send Register Index
  * Send RESTART
  * Send Read Address
  * Read byte
  * Repeat above n times
  * Send STOP

To read multiple registers, simply send a write with the starting register, then read as many times as you like to get as many registers as you like.
